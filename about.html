				<p>Noah was born and raised in Arizona, USA. He started learning violin when he was five and quit shortly thereafter. 
				Then, in 5th grade when his school offered a band program, he played clarinet for a year and then switched to oboe. He is now an 
				acclaimed student oboist in the state. Shortly after beginning to play clarinet, his interest in music blossomed and he discovered the free music 
				notation software, MuseScore, when he was 10. From ages 10 to 13, most of his creations were unsubstantial and unimpressive. 
				However, his opus 1 piece, Serenade in A Minor for 2 flutes and oboe, got good reception from his band teacher and fellow members of 
				his school trio. This inspired him to compete in the National Young Composers Challenge for the 2022 Composium. The piece he wrote for this competition, 
				Carnival Waltz, was a big boost to his up-and-coming career, and caught the attention of Dr. Temme, the conductor of the Phoenix Youth Symphony Orchestra’s Philharmonic Orchestra. 
				This led to the performance of his Carnival Waltz—his world premiere—on February 27th, 2022. </p>

			<p>I <b>do not</b> charge for commissions at this time. This is because the exposure of having an ensemble perform one of my works is payment enough.
			<br>When you commission a piece, I will ask (if applicable) if I have your permission to publish the live recording of the piece on YouTube, Spotify, etc. 
			You <b>do not</b> have to say yes to this to commission a piece, it is just helpful for me attracting new clients.
			<br>Also, I will still have full rights to the piece, just not the rights to your specific recording or video of the performance.
